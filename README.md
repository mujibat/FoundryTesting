Ensure that the owner has approved the contract address (this) to spend the token by checking isApprovedForAll().
Token Address

Check that the tokenAddress is not set to address(0) (zero address).
Validate if the specified tokenAddress has a contract associated with it.

Confirm that the price specified for the order is greater than zero.
Signature

(Additional information needed to define the precondition for the signature)
Deadline

Verify that the deadline is set to a timestamp greater than the current block.timestamp.
